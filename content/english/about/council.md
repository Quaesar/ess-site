  title: President
  bio: Hey there! My name is Ewan, I am super excited to be your ESS president this
    year as I enter my fifth year of electrical engineering. I love board games, taking
    care of plants, a good craft beer, and bad puns. If you want to know more about
    ESS or collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out!
