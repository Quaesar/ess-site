CEUS is focused on providing Civil Engineering students at the Schulich School of Engineering with events and resources that support them academically, socially, and in relationships with industry. CEUS hosts social events for its members and other departments throughout the year. Pizza days, a holiday party, and an annual Halloween Kegger are just a few of the great events organized by CEUS. CEUS is responsible for the administration of the Civil Engineering homerooms, desks and vending machines. CEUS hosts an annual Civil Engineering Career Fair as well as industry nights that allow civil engineering students to network with professionals at various stages of their careers. CEUS also hosts academic presentations, student-professor mixers, and industry tours. CEUS has hosted workshops in partnership with the U of C student chapter of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers (CSCE). An international trip is available to CEUS members each year and civil clothing and merchandise can be purchased each semester. To contact CEUS, send an email to ceus@ucalgary.ca.
