BMESS was founded in 2005 as the first biomedical engineering student club in Western Canada. The club has evolved tremendously over the past few years with enthusiastic students and professors working together on new initiatives to open opportunities to energize, excite, and engage engineering students. We oversee many academic and social events aimed at enriching classroom learning, including Tours, Distinguished Speaker Series, an Industry Panel, and Student-Faculty Mixers. BMESS also hosts a number of different events through out the year including bi-monthly waffles in the Engg Lounge, a Gingerbread House Building Contest, Halloween Pumpkin Carving, and Games Night. We join with EEESA to organize other events, including a soccer/dodgeball tournament. For more information, email us at bmess@ucalgary.ca or visit www.ucalgary.ca/~bmess/.
