GESS strives to represent the students of Geomatics Engineering and provide them with the support and opportunities required to be as successful as possible at the University of Calgary. GESS is committed to fostering ongoing connections with industry and enriching studentsâ€™ social and academic experience within the department. GESS provides a multitude of invaluable student resources for all your Geomatics needs. We also organize many successful social, academic, and industry focused activities throughout the year, namely: Meet the 2nd years, Ski Trip, frequent industry guest speakers and dinners, Switzerland Trip, and our annual Geomatics Career Exposition where students can meet industry members and broaden their industrial network. This year, we are excited to be hosting our Expo in collaboration with the 2nd annual National Geomatics Competition, where geomatics students from across Canada will be coming together at the University of Calgary to showcase their knowledge in solving real world geomatics problems.
