Hey everyone!   My name is Amanda (she/her), and I'm entering my third year of Civil Engineering with a double minor in Energy/Environmental Engineering & MEED (yeah, it's low key a mouthful). As VP Operations, I will manage everything in the ESS office (located in the Engineering lounge),  oversee daily operations related to ESS, and create new merchandise alongside VP Internal! When I am not busy with school, I'm binging Netflix, golfing, or ice skating. ESS is dedicated to enriching the lives of Schulich students, so I hope you enjoy your time here! Be sure to stop by the ESS office or shoot me an email if you ever want to chat! I look forward to meeting all of you in the safest way possible.
