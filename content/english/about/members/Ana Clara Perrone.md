Hey everyone, my name is Ana Clara, but you can call me Ana! I’m super excited to be joining ESS again, this time as one of your Social Commissioners! I'm in second year Software Engineering, even though this may as well be my first year on campus, and after an entire year of virtual school, I am more than ready to meet you all in person, and help the VP Student Life throw as many amazing social events as possible! Please feel free to reach out to me anytime you would like, whether that is regarding an event, your event ideas, or if you just want to chat! I absolutely love to connect with people! When I’m not in school, or doing homework, I'll most likely be trying to find new things to do in our lively city! I love music, movies, TV shows, short films, you name it! But most importantly, I love hanging out with my friends and getting outdoors. If you see me around, please come say hello!
