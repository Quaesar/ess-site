Hola everyone :) My name is Avi and I am your VP Student Life this year. I will be in charge of organizing most of the events held by ESS, so if there’s an event you’d like to see happen you can come to talk to me. My job is to make sure you are welcomed into the Schulich community. There’s always a way to get involved regardless of the type of person you are so come down and say hi sometime :) Make sure to not miss out on FROSH week
