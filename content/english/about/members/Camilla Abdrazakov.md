 Heyo! My name is Camilla, and I’m entering my third year of mechanical engineering with a digital minor. As your VP Internal, I am in charge of designing dope merch, connecting you with clubs and opportunities, and improving your overall student experience! I also oversee the technology, diversity, and student & alumni engagement commissioners. I love matcha green tea ice cream, rugby, rock climbing, and anything outdoors. I’m also a huge fan of the mountains (BIGG ROCKS!!). Don’t be shy to say hi if you see me around, or reach out to me online!
