Hey all! My name is Dennis, and I’m your Sponsorship Commissioner for this year. I’m entering my third year of electrical engineering with a minor in digital engineering. Along with the help of the Corporate Relations team, I work to connect engineering students to industry professionals by securing sponsorships with companies for the ESS. I’m passionate about the fields of STEM, which is why I decided to become an engineer. It’s a privilege that I get to work with amazing people to build a brighter future through technology. Outside of school, I love playing games, watching anime, and hiking in the mountains. I’m also a basketball fan, with my favorite team being the Raptors of course! I think that getting involved with the community is one of the best things we can do to make the most of our short time here. I’m excited to meet everyone as we transition back to normal. Feel free to say hey if you bump into me!
