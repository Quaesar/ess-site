Hello! My name is Etienne Lagace, and I'm going into my third year of software engineering. I originally planned on going into mechanical engineering with a minor in biomedical engineering; obviously, I got sidetracked a little and did none of that, but my parents are still proud of me. So I must be doing something right. As the new admin commissioner, I'll be helping the operations portfolio handle the ESS office (located in the Engineering Lounge), ESS online store, and the First Year Reps. With the university starting to come back in person, I look forward to seeing a ton of new faces, as well as color-coordinating our ESS merch. Although I can't make any promises, I am color blind after all. On the other hand,  I love locked rooms and can give anyone a recommendation for a good hike.
