Hi everyone! My name is Ghada Eldib, I am a third year chemical engineering student minoring in biomedical engineering and MEED. This 2021 -2022 school year, I will be the VP Academic with ESS! Some of my events include the ESS Dinner and overseeing the Ask An Upper Year program which launched last fall! I have 2 commissioners that I work with and our team is excited to support engineering students this coming year!
