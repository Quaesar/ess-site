Hey y’all! My name is Haaziq Altaf, and I’ll be your VP Corporate Relations this year. I’m entering my third year in mechanical engineering with a minor in digital engineering. I am responsible for managing two commissioners in this portfolio, and the three of us work to connect all engineering students with industry partners with a focus in engineering. I love playing and watching basketball. I credit a lot of my extra-curricular and friendships to ESS through ESS events and leadership, and so try to get involved with the ESS in any capacity you can! For any information on ESS sponsors, industry-related events, and corporate connections, feel free to reach out to me!
