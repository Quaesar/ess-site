Hi! I'm Hiten, your Community Relations Commissioner and a second year Software Engineering major. After being a First Year Rep last year, I’ll be working this year with community partners to help bring benefits, sponsors, and discounts for ESS members, so make sure to check out all the discounts that come with your ESS member card. I like playing soccer, basketball, badminton, hiking and basically every other sport as well. In addition to listening to a lot of music, I’m also often running out of shows to watch. If you see me in person or virtually don’t hesitate to say hi!
