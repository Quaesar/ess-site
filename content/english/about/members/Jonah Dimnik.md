Hey all! My name is Jonah and I will be your VP External for this upcoming year. I am in my third year and I’m studying Mechanical Engineering with a Biomedical specialization. I enjoy all kinds of sports and activities, and you can definitely catch me hanging around all of the exciting events ESS has planned for this year. My role is to represent all of you who make up the engineering student body to two national organizations, Western Engineering Student Societies’ Team (WESST) and the Canadian Federation of Engineering Students (CFES). In addition, I will be helping to oversee the Schulich Engineering Competition which is a phenomenal way to apply the skills that you learn in class and have the opportunity to compete on a regional and national level.
