Hey guys! I'm Katie, your VP Finance for the 2021-2022 school year. I'm a third year Mechanical Engg major with an Energy and Environmental Engg specialization. Most of what I do for council is find funding for our events, competitions and conferences, as well as manage the budget and overall incoming and outgoing money. I do all of this so that our students can have the best possible experience with ESS and at Schulich, and so we can hold bigger and better events. I love to bake, cook, do any outdoor sports, and use my camera constantly. If you see any council photos there is a 50% chance they were taken by me and that I will not be in any of the photos. I can't wait for class to be in-person and I hope to see you all in the ESS office!
