Welcome to ESS! My name is Katrina Chanco, the ESS President for 2021-2022. I will be in my last year of Software Engineering, with a minor in Economics. As we enter the new academic year, it is important to find ways to balance and accommodate for in-person and online activities. Working towards building a strong foundation within ESS will allow us to provide quality services and events to all the Engineering students at the University of Calgary. I have high hopes that we can achieve many incredible feats this year and am grateful to be part of a wonderful council full of outstanding people. Please feel free to reach out if you ever want to “Chat with Kat”
