Hey! I am honored to be one of your social commissioners this year and I will be helping in organizing events hosted by ESS as we return to campus! This year is not like any other and hopefully we can make that transition as smooth and as fun as possible! Iâ€™m excited to work on these events to help you recharge your batteries from school with friends and be part of the Schulich community! I am going into my second year of civil engineering. I am a huge F1 fan, I really enjoy reading and going on road-trips. I look forward to organizing events that will make your university experience unforgettable!
