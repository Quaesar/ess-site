Hi Iâ€™m Lucas and I use he/him pronouns! I will be the Competitions Commissioner for the upcoming 2021/2022 school year while majoring in Software Engineering. I am super excited to begin planning some great competitions for the upcoming year and look forward to seeing some awesome displays of engineering!   Outside of school, I love soccer and I am a huge fan of Chelsea FC. I am also a huge fan of TV shows such as The Office and Parks and Recreation!   I am super excited to be your Competitions Commissioner and look forward to meeting many of you!
