Hi there! My name is Michelle and I am a second year Electrical Engineering student. I am so excited to be the Publications Commissioner for ESS this year! I started out as a First Year Representative and loved the experience, so Iâ€™m thrilled to be back on the council with so many inspiring people who want to make a positive difference in the engineering community. I will be working on the Cogwheel and Yearbook with the Communications portfolio. In my free time, I love reading, travelling, meeting new people, and getting involved in the community. I look forward to being part of an amazing council and making this year an unforgettable one at Schulich!
