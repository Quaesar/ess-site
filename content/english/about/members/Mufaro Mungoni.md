Yoh what’s poppin! My name is Mufaro and I am currently in my second year doing software engineering here at Schulich. I am so excited to be working under the Academic Portfolio as  this year’s Professional Development Commissioner for the ESS. Throughout the year I will be working on events and programs that will assist in developing our professional skills such as networking, resume writing, mock interviews, presentation, etc.  I was born and raised in Zimbabwe. In my spare time I try to read books (I’m not a huge reader but I’m trying to get better), otherwise I watch tv, hang out with friends, play/watch sport (mainly soccer and basketball) and look for any opportunity to grow my character and appreciate different perspectives so I am open to try new things.
