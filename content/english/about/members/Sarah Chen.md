My name is Sarah, and I am the Student and Alumni Engagement Commissioner for this year. I am in my third year of Civil Engineering, and excited to be continuing my involvement within the Schulich community. I am looking forward to contributing to the social and professional collaboration of the student body with Schulich alumni, as well as to engage students through ESS initiatives. Outside of school, I am an aspiring plant mom, a pun enthusiast and a rugby player. I love meeting new people and am always open to receive feedback on club initiatives, events and services, so do not hesitate to reach out! You can contact me through my ESS email  or come chat with me if you see me around campus.
