Hello everyone, I'm Sharlyne and I'm the Academic Commissioner for ESS this year. I am currently in my third year of Civil Engineering and am looking into taking the structural minor in the near future. When I'm not doing piles of homework, you may see me editing videos as videography is one of my major hobbies, spending time outdoors (hiking/biking), or watching hours of Grey's Anatomy haha. As this is my first year being apart of the ESS council, I'm excited to see all that this position has to offer; coordinating events, seeking/providing opportunities, and meeting new people along the way!
