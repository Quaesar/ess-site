My name is Whitney and I’m in my third year of majoring in Chemical Engineering and minoring in Biomedical Engineering. This is my first year being a part of ESS and I’m very excited to join the team. As this years’ Diversity Commissioner, I am excited to continue various initiatives that aim to educate the student body in Schulich about equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI), as well as facilitate events that bring together students and faculty to discuss various topics surrounding EDI. In addition to ESS, I hold various roles in other organizations such as the Association for the Advancement of Science and Engineering Education (AASEE) and Robogals UCalgary. Outside of school, I run an e-commerce business and I enjoy going for walks, trying new foods, filming YouTube videos, day trading and learning new languages.
