Hey everyone, Zach here. I'm a fourth year electrical engineering student and current Finance Commissioner for ESS. My job on council is to help our VP Finance with her day-to-day activities. This includes things like funding applications, accounting and managing our store. You'll likely see me in the office working at the front desk or helping out at the various ESS events.  Fun fact, I've also been part of the SUAV electrical team for the past four years, so feel free to ask me all about clubs and how you can get involved. And of course if you have any questions about ESS I'm here for you.
