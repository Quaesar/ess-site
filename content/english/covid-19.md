The Engineering Students' Society is actively monitoring the current situation surrounding the COVID-19 Pandemic. We are currently evaluating new ways to continue to support our members and the Engineering Students of the University of Calgary.

We are working closely with the University of Calgary to determine the feasibility of the various events organised and attended by the Engineering Students' Society. Additionally, we know that students will face different challenges going into a mostly online fall semester. We are working hard behind the scenes to create resources to support students through this transition.

If you have any suggestions feel free to reach out, we would be happy to hear from you.
