My name is Ewan May, I am very excited to be your Engineering Studentsâ€™ Society president for the upcoming year. For the next 2 weeks myself along with the other engineering department society presidents are going to be working with faculty to determine how courses are going to be delivered in fall.

Because of this, we need your feedback and input as we head into discussions with faculty. The questions are related to your experience from last semester and concerns for this coming semester. If you want your voice to be heard, please fill out this survey within the next week:

In addition, please feel free to email myself or our fantastic VP Academic, Ghada Eldib about concerns you might have for the fall semester at **president at ess.ucalgary.ca** or **academic at ess.ucalgary.ca**
