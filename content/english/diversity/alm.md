**What is “All Lives Matter”?**

“All Lives Matter” is a controversial slogan that gained traction in 2013, when people started using “#AllLivesMatter” in response to the Black Lives Matter Movement, which protests against police brutality and racially-motivated violence against black people. 

Without proper context, the phrase might not seem ill-intentioned because well… all lives should matter, right? However, the slogan has been notorious for attempting to shift the focus off the BLM movement, and dismissing the structural racism and racist violence which the black community faces. Although those who use the phrase may be misinformed and not possess malicious intent, the phrase “All Lives Matter” still carries an ignorant and dismissive connotation.  

**What is wrong with saying “All Lives Matter”?**
1. It’s a Weaponized Phrase meant to Silence the Oppressed 
All lives do matter. This goes without saying. However, deep-rooted systemic racism and police brutality against the Black community has shown time and time again that black lives don’t seem to matter. 

The agenda of the BLM movement is to address these specific issues, not to assert racial dominance or implying that other lives don’t matter, but to assert black lives matter too. Therefore, a person who says “All Lives Matter” is supporting an ideology with the sole agenda of taking the attention away from the plight of the Black community, and silencing their voices. 

The “Black Lives Matter” movement was first created by Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors in 2013, after George Zimmerman was acquitted of shooting and killing 17-year old Trayvon Martin. 

2. It’s Racially Gaslighting
Racial Gaslighting - a tactic used to make marginalized communities question their reality, and manipulating them to feel as though their discriminatory experiences are invalid  

By saying “All Lives Matter”, you are denying the experiences and struggles which are faced by black people. You are implying that their issues are not real, or are not of immense concern, which is extremely damaging. The phrase might feel as though it is uniting us, but at its core, it is a dismissive phrase that aims to invalidate the BLM movement. 

“But when I see you, I don’t see colour.” -- Another example of racial gaslighting, seeking to avoid engaging in uncomfortable, problem-solving, meaningful conversations about racism, bias, exclusion and discrimination. 

3. It’s Basic Logic 
It’s a logic issue. All lives should matter because all human lives have value intrinsically. However, If it were actually true that we live in a world where ‘All Lives Matter,’ then that would mean saying ‘Black Lives Matter’ shouldn’t feel like an uncomfortable expression. 

Because we know that black lives often do not experience the same equality or justice, in areas such as the justice system, job security, socioeconomic status, educational opportunities and more, those disparities must first be abolished so that all lives are truly seen as equal. 

Fact: In a study examining statistics from 2000-2017, black people in Toronto made up an average 8.3% of the Canadian population but account for 37% of the victims of fatal encounters with the police.

All American Boys by Jason Reynolds and Brendan Kiely is a great fictional book that reflects the reality of a country divide by racial tension.
