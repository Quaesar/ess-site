Pandemic fatigue is a response to prolonged anxiety and stress, in which the person becomes apathetic or impatient to move forward and feels less motivated or inclined to follow current health protocols. Its sometimes referred to as Caution Fatigue, as a big part of living in a pandemic, is ensuring you’re keeping yourself and others safe at all times. A big part of prevention is educating yourself about the warning signs, and learning new coping mechanisms, so you can live a happy and healthy lifestyle this year!

**The symptoms can include:**
- Reduced work performance
- Lack of energy
- General anxiety
- Increased irritability
- Feeling constantly sad or hopeless
- Inability to complete daily tasks 

If you’re feeling overwhelmed or isolated, you’re not alone. The Angus Reid Institute gathered 150 people in 2020, and asked them what words best described their last couple weeks. The top two responses were worn out/ fatigued (with 31%) and anxious (with 28%), with positive emotions like supported (7%), untroubled (7%), and energized (3%) bringing up the bottom of the list. This is especially important for university students to realize, as Canadians age 18 – 34 are most likely to experience Covid-19 fatigue and least likely to follow advice from health officials. 

Some small steps for students to start feeling better are:
Ditch desensitizing media – take breaks from consuming media and only follow credible and helpful resources 
Stay physically distant, not socially distant – attend club meetings and activities socially, find ways to celebrate big milestones like birthdays from afar
Explore new coping techniques – try different breathing exercises, yoga, meditation, or a new hobby
Get outside – walk your dog, go for a hike, try skating at a local rink
Exercise – whether its dancing in your kitchen or lifting home-made weights, it’s a great way to release endorphins and have fun 

When hanging out with friends or getting out of the house, it’s important to aim for low risk activities, and limit those that are classified as high risk so we can keep everyone safe.

**Low risk:** 
- ordering takeout/delivery from a restaurant
- socially distanced picnic at the park
- backyard BBQ with social circle
**Medium risk:**
- going to your local public pool to swim
- climbing on play structures at the park
- eating on the outdoor patio at a restaurant
**High risk:**
- dining inside a crowded restaurant
- attending an indoor house party with people outside of your social circle
- going to bar to watch a sports event on tv
