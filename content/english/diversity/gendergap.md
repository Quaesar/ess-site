The gender gaps are generally high in the fastest-growing and highest-paid jobs of the future, like engineering. Women make up only 21% of the engineering majors while only 28% of the workforce in STEM are women [3]. It is also important to note that women are mote likely to leave STEM.

This raises a singular, but very important question: but why?

There is no clear answer to why women are underrepresented in STEM and why they are more likely to leave; this lack of clear answer mainly comes from the fact that there are multiple contributing factors. For instance, women often face the prospect of unequal pay and limited progression in their careers. Gender stereotypes, the lack of role models, and a large gap in confidence are also contributing factors [3]. 
Women in “masculine” positions, such as engineers, are seen in a more negative light and are often judged as less competent [2]. When a woman is competent in a “masculine” position, she is deemed less likable; however, both of these attributes – likeability and competence – are essential in the success of an individual in the workforce [2].
Fewer role models represented in the media and pop culture, also means that young girls may lack role models to look up to, which could have inspired their interest in STEM [2].

Well… what does all this mean for their mental health?

The large imbalance in gender means that women may naturally view themselves as outsiders; this may lead to an excessive need to prove their abilities. Adding gender bias to the equation and many other factors that may make the engineering environment uncomfortable, traumatic responses may skyrocket – increasing stress levels, anxiety, being in a constant fight-or-flight position (which can be very mentally demanding), imposter syndrome, and depression [1].
It is crucial to note the longer, permanent damage this may cause to the next generation, where such difficulties may discourage other women from joining STEM.

Then, what can we do?
It is by changing these negative attitudes and stereotypes toward women in STEM, that we will reduce some of the stress women face, help them choose STEM as a career and stay in these fields while staying happy and healthy [1].
	Lastly, without a community of other women, women in STEM can feel defeated and alone; therefore, connection female STEM students with other female professors and/or professionals has been extremely effective at improving women’s self-concept [2]. 
	So, it is important that we connect women in STEM, while ensuring that we change the negative attitudes, biases against, and stereotypes towards women to ensure a comfortable and safe learning and/or working environment.
