**What is neurodiversity?**

An article written by Dr. Nick Walker describes neurodiversity as the diversity of human minds, the infinite variation in neurocognitive functioning within our species. In other words, just as individuals are of diverse skin colors, diverse neurological conditions emerge not from choice, but from normal variations in the human genome. It justifies the notion that how the brain is “wired” determines an individual's cognitive abilities, and that differently “wired” brains are as mainstream as those who consider themselves neurotypical.

**Brief History**

The term neurodiversity was coined by Judy Singer in the late 1990s. A sociologist on the autism spectrum, she rejected the notion that people with autism, or other neurodivergence, were considered disabled. She believed their brains merely worked differently and hoped to shift the focus dialogue of speech, learning, and thinking away from ableist terms such as deficits, disorders, and impairments. 

**Important terminology**

Today, a handful of new terms have emerged and it is important to denote their differences to accurately and properly address neurodiversity. The following have already been used in this post and will continue to make an appearance in future posts created by the neurodiversity department.

**Neurodiversity paradigm**

Unlike neurodiversity, the neurodiversity paradigm is acknowledged as a viewpoint. It reflects the idea that having one “normal” or “healthy” depiction of a brain is a myth and that there is no “right” way of thinking. Just like individuals of different ethnicity, gender, or culture should be treated the same, those who embrace the neurodiversity paradigm believe the same should be true for those who identify as being neurodivergent.

**Neurodivergent**

Simply put, neurodivergence (the act of being neurodivergent) means having a brain that performs in ways that diverge from the social consensus of how a brain “normally” functions. This term does not give way to good or bad connotations, rather, any individual can define themselves as being neurodivergent, given them the choice of describing their neurological difference as positive or negative, desirable or undesirable.

**Neurotypical**

Neurotypical is the term used to describe the neurocognitive function that is generally accepted as the “norm” for society. It is considered the opposite of neurodivergent, equivalent to the relationship straight bears to queer.

**Neurodiverse**

Lastly, neurodiverse is the acknowledgement that one or more members of a group differ greatly from their peers when addressing cognitive abilities. Although similar to the definition of neurodivergent, these terms differ greatly in their grammatical use and should be carefully examined so not to use them as substitutes. An easy trick is to remember that neurodivergent is a term given to an individual and neurodiverse is a term given to a group. So while a group can be described as neurodiverse because some of its members are neurodivergent, it is incorrect to state that a group is neurodivergent because some of its members are neurodiverse.

**More information**

These stepping stones are all anyone needs to become more familiarized and understand the similarities between correctly acknowledging ethnicity, culture, gender, and neurodiversity.
