**Where do these labels come from?**

When the movement for LGBTQIA+ rights gained momentum in the 80’s, it was the gay rights struggle. Proponents justified the term Gay to stand for everyone in the community. But gay wasn’t adequate to describe everyone. So, by the mid-to-late ’80s, lesbians and bisexuals had successfully pushed for inclusion. In the ’90s, it was transgender people’s turn to ask for recognition in the form of the T. Soon after, the Q followed. This addition of the Q was a crucial tipping point, where the community opened its arms wider. Admitting transgender and queer folks was accepting that this movement was not just about sexual orientation but about a broader sense of identity. So it made sense for intersex, asexual, pansexual, and other terms to be included in the acronym.

**Why are there so many labels?**

These labels create a powerful sense of understanding, self-acceptance, and community. When the term transgender was added to the LGB acronym in the ‘90s, it wasn’t that transgender people had never existed before that moment. The term was simply new, replacing earlier, less-affirming vocabulary. Additionally, if a word exists to describe something, it implies that the concept is important enough to merit a term.  It helps describe people and help them describe and realize what label they identify with, or don’t at all.

**Why do people use labels?**

Labels can help classify sexual orientation and gender identity, which is helpful for others who might need more help understanding. Labels are meant to make an individual feel safe, valid, and okay when speaking about their identity. They help communicate parts of the individual to others. In short, labels can provide solidarity while connecting them to those who identify with similar labels as them.

**Do you have to use a label?**

A person can choose to not claim a label as well. Whether they are questioning or don’t feel comfortable sharing that information, they do not have to use labels at all. After all, labels are meant to help and if they don’t, there is no need to use them. Label or no label, it’s about the comfort of the person and how they feel. 

**How do I know what pronoun to use if I’m unsure?**

We recommend asking respectfully rather than guessing. You could say, “I want to be respectful. What gender pronoun do you use?" It is very important to respect each person’s self-identification. Individuals may use female pronouns, male pronouns, gender-neutral pronouns such as ze or hir, or a mix of pronouns. Never use the word "it" when referring to someone.
