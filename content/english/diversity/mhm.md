Join the Engineering Studentsâ€™ Society and the Diversity Advocacy Committee this month as we explore new facets of mental health that are affecting our fellow engineering students. 

**What is Mental Health March?**
Mental Health March is a collection of initiatives in support of student mental health at the Schulich School of Engineering addressed by the ESS. These initiatives directly address issues related to student mental health during COVID-19 and the intersectionality of different identifying groups at SSE, including the focus groups under the Diversity Advocacy Committee - Gender & Sexuality, Racial & Ethnic, Neurodiversity, and Socioeconomic Diversity.
