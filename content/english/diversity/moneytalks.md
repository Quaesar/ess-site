Money. It’s perhaps simultaneously one of the best and worst inventions that humans have created. On one hand currency allows for the trading of goods and have allowed civilizations to flourish through the ages. On the other hand, it’s a real big pain in the ass for various reasons. You must find a way to earn it, attempt to save it and worst of all you might just end up spending more than you earn. “But money is simple right?” perhaps, though you must consider that some people earn a degree by studying it all the time. In essence, money is a tool for you to use; it should not use you. 
	
So now what exactly is “financial literacy” and why should you care? In very basic terms, financial literacy is knowing how money works and what you should be doing with it. It has to do with understanding why things in the modern day are much more expensive than they were in the past (inflation). It is knowing how to manage your money without going on a shopping spree every Friday only to find out that you’re broke the day after. According to a study done by TD bank, youth simply don’t access any financial literacy resources because they either don’t know about them, are unmotivated or are simply unclear about its relevance in their daily lives.  This is more or less what the socioeconomic portfolio will strive for, to provide the resources and education you need to put more greens into your pockets. University especially is a crucial time to pick up personal finance, as it can quite literally make or break your financial future. 
	
If you have an immediate need for resources and are simply dying to learn more, then look no further! Wealthing Like Rabbits by Robert R. Brown is a fantastic introduction to personal finance for Canadians. It is entertaining, informative and a great read overall, it’s a small book that discusses topics such as investment accounts, debt, real estate and so on. If you’re someone who has not touched a book in years then I have a great alternative, his name is Dave Ramsey. Mr. Ramsey is somewhat of a personal finance guru who turned his life around when he was neck-deep in debt. He has a YouTube channel called the Dave Ramsey Show where he makes videos talking about everything personal finance related. 
	
And that’s a wrap! The posts after this one by the socioeconomic diversity portfolio will be an in-depth look at the instruments of personal finance as well as how you as a university student can take advantage of grants, bursaries, and scholarships. Additionally, there will be events and panels where I will host or co-host either games or events to enrich your financial knowledge. There will be an incredible range of topics aside from the ones mentioned so stay tuned for more.
