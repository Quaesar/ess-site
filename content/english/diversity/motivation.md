**What is Motivation?**

Motivation comes from the word motive: a need that requires satisfaction. Needs are gained through: culture, society and lifestyle. From an engineering perspective: “If you are motivated, you learn better and remember more of what you learned.” - Kou Murayama, PhD. Motivation can increase you efficacy to work towards your goals, help you avoid unnecessary risk-taking and addiction and it gives you more control in your life. 

There are 3 components of motivation; the first component component is activation which is an initiation of an action or decision, such applying to engineering. The second is persistence which is a continued effort towards goals no matter the challenges such as taking more classes to get your degree faster. Thirdly is intensity which is having intense concentration to achieve your goals such as studying in the library everyday to study for a specific class. 

**What are some ways to stay academically motivated?**

In the short term: creating a reward system, creating a daily list of tasks and studying with your peers. In the long term: by focusing on your career goals and looking into the bigger picture. 

**What can you do to help someone feel motivated?**

 The first is to remind them of their long term goals, what they want to achieve in the long run and ultimately reminding and supporting them to achieve their goals. The second way is by studying with them, this is a win-win situation because you are testing yourself and at the same time helping others. The last way is by being empathetic and putting yourself in their shoes, how would you feel in their position and how would you move forward from the current position you’re in.
