The stock market is where companies are able to raise funds by issuing shares to the public via the various exchanges and where anyone above the age of 18 can purchase them. You may have either heard, are interested or are participating in the stock market due to some recent events. Let’s break down what the stock market boils down to with our quick crash course.

When you purchase a company’s “stock” you are actually purchasing what are called shares, you can think of these as contracts or “owning” a part of the company. Shares (depending on the class) will typically give you any one of or all of these privileges when you buy them:
-	The right to vote in the company
-	The right to receive dividends (should the board of directors declare them)
-	The right to receive the remaining property of the corporation after it is dissolved (ownership)
Usually only those that have large stakes (percentages) of the company’s stock will be more interested in the right to vote or receive the remaining property as the lay investor may own something like 0.005% or even less of a company’s stock. 

When you hear people say “the markets”, they are most probably referring to a Market Index. An index is a collection of stocks that have their prices tallied together and act as a sort of barometer to see how stocks are doing overall. 
Some of the more common ones in the US are: S&P500 (a collection of 500 companies) the Dow Jones Industrial Average (a collection of 30 large companies) NASDAQ, etc.
Investors should use indices to gauge confidence levels in the markets.

What happens when you bet against a stock, say that you believe that a stock will plummet? You can borrow shares and sell them and then buy them back at a lower price and pocket the difference! Though you can’t just wait for an infinite amount of time to buy the shares back, there’s an expiration date and what’s worse? If the stock price goes up then you could even be in debt. 
Hedge funds betted against GameStop, and they betted hard. They borrowed over 140% of the company’s float (the amount of shares that can be traded on the market) in the belief that the company’s stock price will be worth next to nothing.
Reddit users picked up on this and caused a short squeeze: where those that were shorting the stock were forced to buy it to reduce their losses but caused drastic increases in stock price.

While you want to immediately jump into the fray, you must consider many, many things. 
The first: Don’t buy into the hype, do your due diligence and research and make a rational and reasonable decision. 
The markets are ruthless, remember that you as retail (individual) investor are up against financial institutions worth billions. 
Hindsight is 20/20, ultimately we do not know what will happen tomorrow, there is no real reason a stock should necessarily go up or down for that matter, but we should do our best to minimize risks.
Only risk what you are willing to lose, this is especially true if you are new to the markets, as greed is the prime destroyer of wealth. 

Here are some examples of high-risk and low-risk investments you can choose from:
- LOW RISK
- Blue-Chip Stocks (Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc.)
- ETF’s (Exchange Traded Funds) : ARK, SPY, QQQ, etc.
- Mutual Funds: Vanguard mutual fund, Fidelity mutual fund, WealthSimple Halal Funds, etc.
Index Funds: Vanguard S&P 500, iShares, Fidelity ZERO
- HIGH RISK
- Penny Stocks
- Options (Calls/Puts)
- Shorting Stocks
Speculative Stocks: GME, AMC, NOK, KOSS, etc.
