It is a great learning position on council, and the best way to become involved with ESS in first year engineering. Responsibilities include but are not limited to: 

- Liaising between ESS and first year student body
- Attending weekly ESS meetings as voting members
- Classroom Announcements		
- Advertising ESS events 
- Supporting the team as necessary 

On Friday, September 13th, there will be a fun tryout for all applicants in the Engineering Lounge starting at 5:00 PM. Applicants are encouraged to attend this tryout in a creative costume (bonus points will be given if the costume is worn the entire day leading up to the tryout!). 
**Each applicant will be scheduled for an interview between September 16-20 based on his/her availability. Please let us know your availability for the interview when you drop off/email in your application.**

Please submit a personalized and creative project along with your application before the tryout on Friday, September 13th. USE YOUR IMAGINATION; ANYTHING GOES! Past applicants have done everything from statues made out of cans, to Supercow cakes to ‘It’s Schulich Time’ clocks. Get creative!
