Founded in 2013, Alberta Collegiate Robotics is a University of Calgary club, a FIRST alumni group, and a registered non-profit.

​

Our club consists of Robotics, Mechatronics, and Tech enthusiasts who love to create, make, and share projects.

 

We aim to create the leaders of tomorrow by providing a safe, fun, and challenging environment for youth and post-secondary students to engage with engineering and robotics.

​

If you are a student who wants to get a mix of technical experience, volunteerism through STEM outreach, and get involved within the local youth Robotics community, AC Robotics is the team for you!
