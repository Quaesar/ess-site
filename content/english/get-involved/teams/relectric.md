Relectric Car Team was launched in 2019 in order to research affordable high-performance electric vehicles (EVs). Our team provides students an opportunity to gain technical engineering experience in an environment where collaboration is heavily encouraged.
Currently, EVs are relatively expensive and difficult to find on the used car market. Our team aims to convert existing cars for a fraction of the price of a new vehicle, without sacrificing quality or features. Additionally, we strive to simplify user experience through software and create a unified experience that rivals modern cars.
