SOAR is a student engineering team geared towards designing, building, testing, and flying hybrid and solid sounding rockets. Our interdisciplinary team competes in two competitions yearly, at both Launch Canada as well as at the SA Cup/IREC Competition. This past year we’ve been busy working on two new rockets: Osprey – our 10K Solid and Ouroboros – our 30K Hybrid. If you’re interested in things like propulsion systems, designing embedded circuit boards or even working with composites, SOAR is the place to be!
