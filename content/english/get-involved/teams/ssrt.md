The Schulich Space Rover Team (SSRT) is UCalgaryâ€™s design team for Mars Rovers. Started in September 2019, the team is looking forward to competing in its first competition at the Canadian International Rover Challenge in August 2021! Created as a project based club, the SSRT is an exciting opportunity for students to participate in hands-on engineering experience. With mechanical, mechatronics, software, electrical, science, and business sub-teams, Schulich Space Rover provides extracurricular design opportunities in a fun and competitive environment.
