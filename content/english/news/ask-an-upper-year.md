description: A program for first-year students to speak with upper-years!
type: post

---
The Engineering Student Society (ESS) is excited to announce the commencement of an open support program geared towards first-year engineering students: **_Ask An Upper Year_**!

> This program offers casual one-on-one support between incoming first-year and upper-year engineering students; helping new students to reach out to their peers regarding any questions they may have or adversaries they may be facing. The upper-year students are knowledgeable in various support resources available within the University of Calgary and are eager to share their personal advice and experiences to you! In an online environment, this is a great opportunity for you to build connections with upper years, and improve your transition into first-year engineering.

**_Ask An Upper Year_** consists of “drop-in” based meetings, accommodating first-year schedules. We want to be available when you are! Directors have taken the liberty to make the program duration to best fit your busy lives and allow for maximum time to talk to the upper years. Pop by to ask a quick question, or have a heart-to-heart discussion; the duration of the session is completely up to you.

    

Zoom meetings provide you flexibility when communicating with an upper year. Based on your comfort level, you can speak to an upper year using the mic or message with an upper year through the online chat function.  
Embarking on this new chapter, the engineering-student community is here for you every step of the way! We hope you take advantage of this engaging opportunity and wish you the best of luck in your first year.
