# Plenery

**Plenary** is a preparatory event for the General Meeting, where all engineering undergraduates can participate in shaping the future direction of ESS. These sessions are meant to discuss and make changes to motions submitted by ESS members and then to table the motions to the General Meeting after the discussion. They will be run with the same format as the General Meeting to allow attendees to familiarize themselves with the General Meeting process beforehand.
