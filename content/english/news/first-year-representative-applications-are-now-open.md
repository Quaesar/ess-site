ESS selects 8 First Year Representatives (FYRs) each year to become a part of council (2 per block), and take on various duties pertaining to ESS. The main responsibility of the FYR are including but not limited to:

* Liaising between ESS and first year student body
* Zoom Announcements
* Attending weekly ESS meetings as voting members
* Advertising ESS events
* Supporting the team as necessary

You will gain experience running events, speaking in public, and join a team of students passionate about creating a positive university experience for others. It is a great learning position on council, and the best way to become involved with ESS in first year engineering.
